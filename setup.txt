Note: this does not include an index file or anything other than the login, registration, reset password forms and welcome page and included bootstrap 5.2 beta 1 and font awesome 6.1.1 files...

note: I did not opt to add a control panel or owner account and user management dashboard in this basic example as this is meant only to be a basic functional starting point for anyone wanting such to then edit / expand upon further. That is all. Best of luck!


Setup:

upload files in the yoursite directory:

Edit:

config/config.php

you only need to edit this:

// Database credentials. Edit: username, password, name
define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
define('DB_NAME', 'yoursite');


then in your browser visit:

db-install.php

to install the users table.
